# Software for Messaging and/or Event Streaming

## Apache Kafka
- Event Streaming
- append only log
    - log is "partitioned" across different servers (brokers)
## Apache Pulsar
- Event Streaming
## Azure Service Bus
- Event Streaming
## Amazon SQS
- Even Streaming
## Redis (Streams API) 
- Event Streaming
## RabbitMQ
(Really a queue, not meant for event streaming, but about the best for just queuing.)


This is really cool - started at Microsoft, now a Cloud Native Initiative

Cross platform, works with Node, C#, Java, Go, or anything really.

Has WAY more than just messaging (service invocation, configuration, etc. )
